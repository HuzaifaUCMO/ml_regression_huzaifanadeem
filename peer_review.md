1. Clarity & Organization
The notebook is well-structured, following a logical progression from data loading to model evaluation. Each section is clearly labeled, and the use of Markdown cells enhances readability. The inclusion of visualizations, such as histograms and scatter plots, aids in understanding the data distribution and relationships between variables.

Suggestions:

Consider adding a table of contents at the beginning for easier navigation.

Including brief explanations before each code block can help readers understand the purpose of the code.

2. Feature Selection & Justification
The selected features, including horsepower, weight, and displacement, are appropriate for predicting MPG, as they are directly related to a vehicle's fuel efficiency. The justification for choosing these features is well-articulated, referencing domain knowledge and data correlations.

Suggestions:

Explore the inclusion of additional features like acceleration or model year to assess their impact on model performance.

Provide a correlation matrix to visually support the feature selection process.

3. Model Performance & Comparisons
The notebook implements both linear and polynomial regression models, comparing their performance using RÂ² and RMSE metrics. The results are clearly presented, with the polynomial model showing improved performance, which is expected due to its ability to capture non-linear relationships.

Suggestions:

Include a discussion on the potential for overfitting with higher-degree polynomial models.

Consider using cross-validation to provide a more robust evaluation of model performance.

4. Reflection Quality
The reflections are thoughtful and demonstrate a clear understanding of the modeling process. The author discusses the rationale behind feature selection, the implications of model performance metrics, and potential areas for improvement.

Suggestions:

Reflect on the limitations of the current models and propose strategies to address them.

Discuss how the insights gained from this project could be applied to real-world scenarios or future projects.
